          I am Andie Rabino. I took up a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Computer Science from the University of the Philippines Diliman.
          I started taking Computer Engineering but I shifted my path into software engineering instead.

          I am a person who can spend a whole day in front of the screen.
          Designing and developing websites are things that I enjoy doing.
          I am also looking forward to be a UI/UX specialist someday. You can view my resume <a target="=_blank" href="/static/files/resume-of-andie-rabino.pdf">here</a>.

          My favorite food is spaghetti. I hated spicy food not until I lived in Korea for 10 months back in 2012.
          I play League of Legends and my main character is Lux. I am interested in watching Korean movies and series.
